# Contributing to the Parse Dashboard

When working on the dashboard, use `npm run dashboard` and visit `localhost:4040` to see your dashboard.

When working on components, use `npm run pig` and visit `localhost:4041` to view our component library and documentation. The demos for each component are the primary way we test components, although there are also a small number of automated tests you can run with `npm test`.
