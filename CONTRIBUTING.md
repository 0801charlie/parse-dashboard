# Contributing to Parse Dashboard
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Our Development Process
The standard installation method also clones the git repository, so you can start making and submitting changes right away. For convenience, you can use `git update-index --assume-unchanged Parse-Dashboard/parse-dashboard-config.json` to ignore your own personal configuration.

When working on the dashboard, use `npm run dashboard` and visit `localhost:4040` to see your dashboard.

When working on components, use `npm run pig` and visit `localhost:4041` to view our component library and documentation (you can have both running at once). The demos for each component are the primary way we test components, although there are also a small number of automated tests you can run with `npm test`.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
