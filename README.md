# Parse Dashboard

An open source dashboard for managing your Parse apps.

To run it:

```
git clone git@github.com:ParsePlatform/parse-dashboard.git
cd parse-dashboard
npm install
npm run-script dashboard
```

 Next add your app into parse-dashboard/Parse-Dashboard/parse-dashboard-config.json. Ask Drew how to do this. It is currently difficult, but it will get better.

 Then visit http://localhost:4040 and you will be able to manage your parse apps.
